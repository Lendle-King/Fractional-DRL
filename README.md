# Fractional Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing
Tensorflow implementation of the algorithm of Fractional Deep Reinforcement Learning for Age-Minimal Mobile Edge Computing. Networks are trained using Tensorflow 2.6 and Python 3.8. Please refer to our paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10418.
## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
The convergence experiment can be run by calling:
```
python -u ./main.py  --folder 'storage' --subfolder 'standard_test' 
```
Detailed environment settings alternations please refer to the auguments part of file 'main.py'.
